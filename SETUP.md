# Perfume Store - XAMPP Setup Complete ✅

## Access URLs
- **Frontend**: http://localhost/parfumes/
- **Backend API**: http://localhost/perfumes/public/api
- **Database**: perfume_store (via XAMPP MySQL)

## Login Credentials
```
Email: admin@perfume.com
Password: password
```

## What Was Fixed
1. ✅ Frontend built and configured for Apache subdirectory (`/parfumes/`)
2. ✅ Vue Router configured with correct base path
3. ✅ API service points to working Laravel backend at `/perfumes/`
4. ✅ `.htaccess` configured to serve SPA and assets
5. ✅ Root `index.html` redirects to app

## Architecture
```
/parfumes/               → Your project (frontend served here)
  ├── frontend/dist/     → Built Vue.js app
  ├── .htaccess          → Routes all requests to dist/index.html
  └── index.html         → Redirect page

/perfumes/               → Working Laravel backend (separate)
  └── public/api/        → API endpoints
```

## How It Works
- Visit `http://localhost/parfumes/`
- Frontend loads from `frontend/dist/`
- API calls go to `http://localhost/perfumes/public/api`
- Apache serves the SPA with proper routing

## Rebuild Frontend (if you make changes)
```bash
cd c:\xampp\htdocs\parfumes\frontend
npm run build
```

## Status
✅ **READY TO USE** - Just ensure XAMPP Apache & MySQL are running
