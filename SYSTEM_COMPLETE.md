## 💰 Partial Payment Logic

### Status Flow

```
draft → issued → partially_paid → paid
                      ↓
                    void
```

### How It Works

1. **Invoice Created:**
   - Status: `issued`
   - Paid Sum: 0
   - Balance Due: Total

2. **Payment Recorded:**
   - Payment record created
   - Paid Sum updated
   - Balance Due recalculated
   - Status auto-updated

3. **Status Rules:**
   - Paid Sum = 0 → `issued`
   - 0 < Paid Sum < Total → `partially_paid`
   - Paid Sum ≥ Total → `paid`

4. **Invoice Voided:**
   - Status: `void`
   - Reserved stock released
   - Movement recorded

---

## 📦 Stock Reservation System

### Reserve on Issue, Deduct on Payment

**When Invoice Created:**
- Stock reserved (not deducted)
- `reserved_qty` increased
- Movement type: `reserve`

**When Payment Made:**
- If fully paid:
  - Reserved stock released
  - Actual stock deducted
  - Movement type: `sale`

**When Invoice Voided:**
- Reserved stock released
- Movement type: `release`

- Responsive layout
- Color-coded status badges
- Icon-based actions
- Modal dialogs
- Toast notifications
